				<h1>A Eulogy for {{ word[0].upper() + word[1:] }} </h1>
			</div>
		<p>
		A famous writer once said “We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give”.
		<br>		
		If that is true, then {{word}} made a great life.
	      	<br>
		They were the most giving person I’ve ever known.
	 	<br>      	
		And judging from the nodding heads I see in front of me, it seems that many of you agree.
		</p>


		<p>
		{{ word[0].upper()+word[1:]}}  was born on {{date}} in {{city}}. 
		<br>
		They were the child of {{father}} and {{mother}}. They lived in {{city}} from {{year}} to {{year}}, and later moved to {{city}} and {{city}}.
		</p>

		<p>
		{{ word[0].upper()+word[1:]}} went to {{school}} and graduated with {{degree}}.
	       	<br>
		They then went to work for {{company}} as a {{job}}.
		<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		In {{marrage_year}} met {{spouse}} and they were married {{marrage_years}}.
		<br>
		Eventually they had one child.
		<br>
		Last year, {{word}} and {{spouse}}  celebrated their 50th anniversary.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		{{ word[0].upper() + word[1:] }}  was very active in the {{community}} community.
		<br>
		{{word[0].upper() + word[1:]}} devoted many hours to {{hobby}} and was known for {{quality}}.
		</p>

		<p>
		{{ word[0].upper() + word[1:] }} was a remarkably {{character1}}  person. They were a person of great {{character2}} and {{character3}}.
		<br>
		Above all, {{word}} believed in {{value}}.  They always said “{{randomWords}}”.
		<br>
		Those are words of wisdom that I will always cherish.
		<br>
		<br>
		In closing, I would like to share this poem with you:
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>
		Do not stand at my grave and weep,
		<br>
		I am not there, I do not sleep.
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a thousand winds that blow.
		<br>
		I am the diamond glint on snow.
		<br>
		I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
		<br>
		I am the gentle autumn rain.
		<br>
		<br>
		When you wake in the morning hush,
		<br>
		I am the swift, uplifting rush
		<br>
		Of quiet birds in circling flight.
		<br>
		I am the soft starlight at night.
		<br>
		<br>
		Do not stand at my grave and weep.
		<br>
		I am not there, I do not sleep.
		</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		{{word[0].upper() + word[1:]}},  thank you for being part of our lives. We are all going to miss you.
